## What Is Balady Framework?

**Balady Framework™** is a chaos-aware, creativity-first delivery model inspired by real-world Egyptian work culture — where:

- Requirements change mid-sentence  
- Delivery happens before approval  
- Status is always 🟢 green (even when 🔴 red inside)  
- And somehow… things still ship

It is **not Agile**, **not Waterfall**, **not SAFe**, **not Spotify**.

It is **Balady**.

## Why “Watermelon”?

Because everything looks fine on the outside:

🟢 Green status  
🟢 Green dashboards  
🟢 Green management reports  

But internally?

🔴 Fires  
🔴 Panic  
🔴 Last-minute heroics  

Yet delivery still happens.  
This is not a bug. This is the system.

## Core Philosophy (الفلسفة البلدي)

1. **Chaos Is a Feature**
   - If everything is clear from day one, something is wrong.

2. **Creativity Beats Process**
   - Rules exist until a smarter workaround appears.

3. **Reality Over Rituals**
   - If it works in production, the design was correct — retroactively.

4. **People > Frameworks**
   - The fixer, the hero, and “بتاع كله” are critical roles.

5. **Delivery Is the Only KPI**
   - Documentation is optional. Survival is not.
